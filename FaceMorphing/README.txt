1) This project is writen in matlab so just put the current folder to Project_2 main file.

2) I have put in the comments in the main file for the respective morph and atlas instructions. Just uncomment those if you wish to run them.

3) The kernel choosing is in the parameters file. The last value in the file is:- 01:guassian, 02:thin plate splines, 03:inverse quadratic.

4) Additional inputs are present in the subfolders of Input folder. This is just for info. main.m already has the correct inputs to them for atlas and mirphing. Uncomment those to run.

5) The execution time for the joker morphing is quite high so please be patient.

6) There are wrong outputs as well  int he ouputs folder. These are the outputs with wrong parameters used for experimenting.
